      <p>Michał Gerlach is a dancer, movement director (LAF) and creative consultant associated mainly with the fashion industry.</p>
      <p>Our project aimed to present a motion study through an analog photography style. Michał became the model. In everyday life he works on the other side of the lens, so it was for him a way out of his comfort zone.</p>
      <p>Photographs were created by Maksym Rudnik, which works mainly with the analog technique. He started with shooting board sports, today, staying close to the topic focuses on portrait and documentary. However, regardless of whether he is implementing an original project or a commercial order, he still works almost exclusively on film.</p>
      <p>Because of working with analog equipment, every move, every shot had to be well planned by Michał before.</p>
