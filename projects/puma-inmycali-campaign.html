        The main goal for the PUMA #inmycali activation was to find creative young women and support their activities throughout the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        We teamed up with polish lifestyle magazine Glamour. Together we chose 11 women (representing 9 different businesses) and published their stories in 3 articles supported by 3 dedicated photoshoots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally we organised an Instagram contest in which we looked for 3 creative girls who would join PUMA #inmycali squad and are their stories on Glamour.pl.

      <h4>Project details</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The project helped PUMA to be seen on social media - focusing on a very diverse creative women community</li>
        <li>Choosing girls who are not only creative but also active on social media resulted with a big number of contest applications (over 800!). Each one of the ambassadors brought a very diverse group of women - accordingly to their target groups. All of them were extraordinary!  </li>
        <li>We received a very positive feedback from our #inmycali ambassadors who happily shared the results of photoshoots and interviews creating a positive social media buzz around the project</li>
