        We had the great pleasure to cooperate in the production of the <q>Zdrowie Kobiety</q> podcast series, which was created by Marta Niedźwiecka in cooperation with the FB group Dla Każdej z Nas under the patronage of Reserved brand.
      </p>
      <p>The podcast explores some of the most common mental and health difficulties faced by women. Marta’s invited experts to the next episodes. They’ve shared their substantive knowledge and experience related to a given disease. The discussions also featured the voices of people who struggle with diseases on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>The topics of each episode were related to: eating disorders, endometriosis, menopause, autism spectrum disorders, MDM and vulvodynia, hormonal disorders and multiple sclerosis.</p>
